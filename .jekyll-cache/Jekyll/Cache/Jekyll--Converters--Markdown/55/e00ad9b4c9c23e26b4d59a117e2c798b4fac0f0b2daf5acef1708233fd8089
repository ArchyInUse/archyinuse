I"¤<p>Hey everyone, today I want to explore a medium machine on HTB called Administrator.
The main themes that persists throughout this box are AD privilege mismanagement abuse to gain increasingly privileged users, with some password cracking thrown into the mix.
This was a very strange release coming from HTB, as Iâ€™ve not seen OSCP-like boxes in a very long time, but Iâ€™ll touch more on that in the conclusion.</p>
